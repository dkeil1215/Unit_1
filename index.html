        <h1>How Does urbanization impact water quality?</h1>
        <p>We want to investigate how urbanization affects water quality by examining the changes that occur as cities expand and land use intensifies. As natural landscapes are replaced with roads, buildings, and other impervious surfaces, runoff increases and carries pollutants such as nutrients, sediments, and contaminants into nearby water bodies.<br><br> 
        By studying these relationships, we aim to better understand how urban growth influences water quality and to identify patterns that can inform more sustainable planning and management strategies.</p>

        <h2>Datasets</h2>
        <p>This area will show the datasets being used for this project. These include a variety of point, line, and polygon layers representing urban features such as land use, transportation networks, population density, and watershed boundaries. <br><br>
        Additionally, water quality datasets will be included, such as monitoring station locations and measurements of key indicators (e.g., nutrients, chlorophyll-a, turbidity) collected over multiple years. Where applicable, links to both the original data sources and cleaned, analysis-ready tables will be provided to support transparency and reproducibility.</p>
